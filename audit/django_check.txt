WARNINGS:
?: (drf_spectacular.W001) /home/runner/workspace/invoices/api/views.py: Warning [InvoiceTemplateViewSet]: could not derive type of path parameter "id" because it is untyped and obtaining queryset from the viewset failed. Consider adding a type to the path (e.g. <int:id>) or annotating the parameter type with @extend_schema. Defaulting to "string".

?: (drf_spectacular.W001) Warning: enum naming encountered a non-optimally resolvable collision for fields named "status". The same name has been used for multiple choice sets in multiple components. The collision was resolved with "StatusE4aEnum". add an entry to ENUM_NAME_OVERRIDES to fix the naming.
?: (security.W002) You do not have 'django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware' in your MIDDLEWARE, so your pages will not be served with an 'x-frame-options' header. Unless there is a good reason for your site to be served in a frame, you should consider enabling this header to help prevent clickjacking attacks.
?: (security.W004) You have not set a value for the SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS setting. If your entire site is served only over SSL, you may want to consider setting a value and enabling HTTP Strict Transport Security. Be sure to read the documentation first; enabling HSTS carelessly can cause serious, irreversible problems.
?: (security.W008) Your SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT setting is not set to True. Unless your site should be available over both SSL and non-SSL connections, you may want to either set this setting True or configure a load balancer or reverse-proxy server to redirect all connections to HTTPS.
?: (security.W018) You should not have DEBUG set to True in deployment.
