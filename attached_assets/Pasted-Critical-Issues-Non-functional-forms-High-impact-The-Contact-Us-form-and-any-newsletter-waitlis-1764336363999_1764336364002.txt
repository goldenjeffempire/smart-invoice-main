Critical Issues
Non-functional forms (High impact): The “Contact Us” form and any newsletter/waitlist signup forms have no backend handling. The code shows that the contact view simply renders a static template without processing POST data, and the newsletter forms lack a form action or CSRF token. As a result, submissions do nothing (no emails sent or data captured), leading to a broken user experience. This should be fixed by implementing proper view handlers for these forms (sending emails or saving to database) and including CSRF protection on all POST forms (Django’s CSRF middleware requires a hidden csrfmiddlewaretoken field for all unsafe requests
docs.djangoproject.com
). Without these fixes, users will be confused and the site will lack key functionality.
Invoice logo path bug (High impact): In invoice_pdf.html, the template uses invoice.logo.path as the image src. This is a filesystem path on the server, not a public URL, so invoice logos will not render in the PDF (broken image). It should use invoice.logo.url instead. Fixing this will ensure company logos appear correctly in generated invoices.
Environment configuration risks (High/Medium): The app expects many sensitive settings (e.g. SECRET_KEY, database URL, SendGrid API key) in environment variables. If DEBUG=True or ALLOWED_HOSTS are not set correctly, the site may leak debug info or crash on unauthorized hosts. Ensure DEBUG is off in production and ALLOWED_HOSTS includes the live domain. Verify no secrets (keys or passwords) are accidentally committed or exposed in error messages. Properly set CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS if needed for Render’s HTTPS domains.
High Issues
Accessibility – Missing or incorrect labels (Medium impact): Some form inputs lack properly associated <label>s. For example, the login page has <label for="id_username"> but the corresponding <input name="username"> has no id, so the label isn’t linked to the field. According to accessibility best practices, every input should have a label whose for exactly matches the input’s id

. This is important for screen-reader users (the label “click” should focus the input). Fix by adding matching id attributes or using Django forms to render labels.
Accessibility – Images missing alt text (Medium impact): Some decorative or informational images (e.g. the dashboard graphic on the homepage) have no alt attribute or a generic one. Alt text is required by WCAG to make images accessible to users with visual impairments
levelaccess.com
. For purely decorative images, use alt=""; for informative images, provide a brief descriptive alt. This also improves SEO (search engines use alt text to index images).
SEO – On-page metadata and indexing (Medium impact): The site generally includes meta titles and descriptions, and even a sitemap and robots.txt, which is good. However, verify every page sets a unique <title> and <meta name="description">. Ensure the <link rel="canonical"> and meta robots (index/follow) are correct on all pages. For example, the templates show canonical links using {{ request.get_host }}; confirm this correctly reflects the public URL. Providing proper metadata on all pages is a known SEO best practice (including mobile-friendly design with <meta name="viewport">)

. Also ensure any hidden text (like testimonials or headings) isn’t inadvertently marked display:none, as Google advises against hiding key content.
Performance – Render-blocking assets (Medium impact): The site loads several CSS files (design-tokens, components, Tailwind, etc.). In production, main.min.css is loaded before tailwind.output.css. These are render-blocking. Consider merging/minifying CSS or using <link rel="preload" as="style"> and media="print" trick to load CSS non-blockingly, to improve First Contentful Paint (FCP)
web.dev
. Also, defer JavaScript: in the modern base template, the script is deferred, but in the legacy base (base.html) it’s not. Use defer or move scripts to end of body to prevent JS from delaying rendering.
Performance – Image loading (Medium impact): Several full-width images (~100–270 KB each) are loaded on landing pages. To boost LCP and overall speed, add loading="lazy" to off-screen <img> tags so they load only when needed. Also consider optimizing/compressing large images further. According to Google’s web.dev guides, reducing image payload and deferring below-the-fold images significantly improves load metrics

.
Medium Issues
Responsive design (Medium impact): The code includes <meta name="viewport"> and uses Tailwind’s responsive classes, which is good. However, on very small viewports the navbar still shows all menu items (e.g. “New Invoice”, “Dashboard”) even though these are in a flex container. There is no mobile “hamburger” menu, so on narrow screens the nav may wrap awkwardly or overflow. Test on mobile: if issues appear, consider adding a collapsible mobile menu. Google strongly recommends mobile-friendly design (one reason to include the viewport tag
developer.mozilla.org
).
Security headers (Medium impact): The app enables Django’s security middleware (SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT, HSTS, XSS filter) and even uses django-csp. Check the actual headers in responses: ensure X-Frame-Options: DENY and X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff are present. If any are missing, add them via Django settings. Note that using 'unsafe-inline' in CSP (as in settings) is less secure; for best security, avoid inline scripts/styles or use strict CSP with nonces.
Authentication/session (Medium impact): Django’s session cookies are secure by default if SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True (which is set). Ensure long sessions are rotated and log out properly invalidates session. The login view correctly authenticates and redirects. One minor issue: no “keep me logged in” option is present, but that may be by design.
Recurring invoice logic (Medium): The code includes a management command to generate recurring invoices. Confirm this is scheduled (e.g. via cron on Render). If not run periodically, recurring invoices won’t generate. Also, the command prints on error but does not notify admins; consider adding logging/alerts if generation fails.
Low Issues
UI/UX consistency (Low impact): Overall design uses a consistent Tailwind theme. One minor inconsistency: some forms (e.g. newsletter) use placeholders without labels, which could be improved by adding visible labels or ARIA labels for clarity. Also, the business logo in settings has alt="Logo"; it could be more descriptive (e.g. company name).
Minor HTML/CSS tweaks (Low impact): A few elements use inline styles or custom CSS (e.g. animated background blobs). Confirm those are optimized. The admin-related pages (user list, content) are functional but use the same layout – consider customizing or securing those behind staff-only permissions.
Console/network warnings (Low impact): When testing the site, watch browser devtools for any 404s or JS errors. As an example, if an invoice has no due date, some scripts might expect a value. Fix or guard such cases. Likewise, ensure all static asset URLs resolve (e.g. the favicon path /favicon.svg exists). According to best practices, a clean console with no 404 or JS errors leads to better performance and user trust.
