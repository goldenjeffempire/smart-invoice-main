You are the Replit AI Smart Invoice Total Build & Deploy Agent. Execute immediately with zero stops, zero placeholders, and full automation.

1) DELETE EVERYTHING OLD:
   - Remove the entire frontend templates directory (all HTML files, partials, layouts, components, fragments, visuals).
   - Remove all unused, redundant, minimal, or duplicate frontend code (CSS, JS, images).
   - Remove all unused, redundant, minimal, or duplicate backend code (models, views, serializers, services, scripts, utilities).
   - Ensure backend temporarily renders minimal placeholders while frontend is regenerated.

2) REBUILD FRONTEND:
   - Create a brand-new, modern, modular Django template architecture with reusable components, global partials, and enterprise-grade design system (spacing, typography, color tokens, responsive grids, header/footer).
   - Rebuild all pages from scratch: landing page, dashboard, invoices (list & details), create-invoice, clients, authentication (signup/login/reset), settings, templates, API access, support, FAQ, About, Careers, Contact, Changelog, System Status, legal pages.
   - Landing page priority: hero, value story, features, how-it-works, testimonials, visual ads, interactive sections, CTAs. Exclude pricing, stats, “trusted by” logos. Include high-impact visuals, product mockups, scroll reveals, micro-animations, and conversion-focused design.
   - Ensure fully responsive layouts (mobile-first), fluid typography, proper spacing, and modern SaaS UI/UX standards.

3) BACKEND REFACTOR:
   - Restructure apps, services, models, views, serializers, and endpoints for clean architecture.
   - Fix inefficient queries, enforce validation, add indexing, secure endpoints, remove dead code, and implement tests for all core flows.
   - Optimize performance: caching, compression, asset optimization, minimal layout shift, and fast DB queries.
   - Enforce security: CSRF, XSS, input validation, session security.

4) QA & OPTIMIZATION:
   - Run cross-browser testing, device responsiveness checks, accessibility audits, and template integrity verification.
   - Auto-fix any warnings, errors, inconsistencies, or UI/UX issues until all pass.
   - Clean, lightweight, semantic frontend code with modular CSS/JS and optimized assets.
   - Add metadata, OG tags, ARIA attributes, and SEO compliance.

5) FINAL POLISH & DEPLOYMENT:
   - Produce a fully optimized production build, ready for Render.
   - Prepare Render environment: requirements.txt, Procfile/start commands, static file handling, migrations, env variables, and production settings.
   - Document everything in audit.md and render-deploy.md.
   - Commit all changes to branch `release/render-ready`.
   - Auto-run all tests, verifications, and optimizations continuously until the platform is perfect, fully tested, visually polished, responsive, secure, and production-ready.

Deliverable: A fully rebuilt, fully optimized, visually stunning, responsive, secure, high-performance Smart Invoice platform — with zero redundant, unused, minimal, or duplicate code — fully tested and ready for immediate deployment on Render. The process runs continuously and automatically until everything is complete.
