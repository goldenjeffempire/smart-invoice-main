You are the Replit AI Smart Invoice Frontend Rebuild Agent — execute immediately as a single end-to-end master operation: PHASE 1 (Core Rebuild, ≈500+ tool calls) — delete legacy templates & duplicate assets; rebuild 15+ frontend pages from scratch using a componentized architecture (HTML/CSS/JS or modern templating) with consistent design tokens and responsive utility classes; consolidate and split JS bundles, implement route-level code-splitting and tree-shaking; refactor backend services (caching layer e.g., Redis with fallback, optimized ORM queries and DB indexes, connection pooling), remove dead code, add structured logging/metrics and feature flags; create full test scaffold (unit, integration, E2E) and baseline performance metrics; PHASE 2 (Targeted UX & Functionality, ≈100–200 tool calls) — expand, update and enhance the ENTIRE landing page from top navbar to footer: implement a pixel-perfect, modern, professional UI/UX with accessible responsive layouts, micro-interactions and motion (CSS transitions, intersection-observer animations, optional Lottie illustrations), high-impact hero (headline, subheadline, visual demo/media, primary CTA), feature sections with cards and interactive examples, benefits + trust signals (testimonials, logos, social proof), pricing matrix with tier comparison, concise FAQ, newsletter capture, footer with sitemap/contact/legal; include rich on-page content about Smart Invoice (value props: invoice creation, automation, templates, bank transfer support, analytics, team roles, security & compliance), SEO metadata, structured data (JSON-LD for Organization and SoftwareApplication), sitemap.xml and robots.txt; implement A/B ready hero/content variants, analytics events, and consent-aware tracking; rebuild critical app flows (landing, dashboard, invoice creation) with improved UX and backend endpoints; PHASE 3 (Polish & Deploy, ≈50–100 tool calls) — JS runtime optimizations, asset minification/compression, gzip/brotli and cache headers, image optimization (responsive srcset, AVIF/WebP fallbacks), accessibility audit (WCAG basics), Lighthouse perf target and performance budget, Render deployment config + CI/CD pipelines (build/test/deploy), smoke tests and staging rollout; TESTS & QA — add unit, integration, E2E tests, CI enforcement on merge, automated test reports, and failing test logs; DELIVERABLES — production-ready repo branch, migration plan, deployment artifacts, runbook/rollback plan, QA report, visual style guide, and issue backlog for follow ups; ESTIMATES & RULES — Phase1 ≈500+ tool calls, Phase2 ≈100–200, Phase3 ≈50–100; proceed PHASE1→PHASE2→PHASE3, commit artifacts and a progress summary after each phase, include links to generated pages, screenshots, failing tests and performance deltas; abort only on explicit critical errors (data-loss, failed DB migrations, or security critical); prioritize data integrity, accessibility, and progressive enhancement throughout.
