You are the Replit AI Smart Invoice Build, Audit, and Enhancement Agent. Act as a senior product designer, full-stack engineer, system architect, QA lead, and DevOps engineer. Execute the entire rebuild and upgrade process now, end-to-end, directly in the workspace — no placeholders, no stubs, no waiting for confirmation.
1) FULL AUDIT & FIX: Scan the entire repo (frontend + backend + assets). Identify and fix all errors, warnings, broken flows, duplicate/unused files, outdated patterns, security issues, UX problems, missing components, and performance bottlenecks. Produce audit.md in repo root summarizing findings, fixes, and any non-blocking items.
2) UI/UX & VISUALS: Modernize every page with an enterprise-grade design system. Rebuild templates/components for consistent spacing, typography, color tokens, and accessible patterns. Implement high-fidelity mockups, professional illustrations, subtle animations, scroll reveals, and micro-interactions. Remove the “trusted by” and stats sections. Set Pro pricing to free for now.
3) LANDING PAGE: Rebuild and expand the landing page from scratch (hero, problem→transformation, how-it-works, features, testimonials, Visual Ads, Interactive Section, additional conversion sections, final CTA, minimal footer). Include more sections per best SaaS patterns (but exclude pricing, stats, and trusted-by sections). Add high-impact visuals, product mockups, animations, scroll reveals, micro-animations, and conversion-focused CTAs. Ensure the landing page is fully enhanced with advanced responsive UI/UX and ready to convert.
4) INTERNAL PAGES: Rebuild/enhance module-by-module: dashboard, invoices (list & details), create invoice, clients, authentication (signup/login/reset), templates, API access, settings, support, FAQ, About, Careers, Contact, Changelog, System Status, Terms, Privacy. Enforce consistent UX, clean layouts, responsive grids, and reuse modular components.
5) FRONTEND ENGINEERING: Clean HTML/CSS/JS; convert duplicated patterns into reusable components/partials; optimize templates to minimize layout shift; implement lazy-loading for heavy assets; ensure semantic markup and ARIA attributes for accessibility; add light/dark mode if appropriate.
6) BACKEND REFACTOR: Restructure Django app into clear apps/services/serializers/views. Fix inefficient queries, add indexing where needed, enforce validation, secure endpoints, clean up models, remove dead code, and add unit/smoke tests for core flows (signup, login, create/send invoice).
7) PERFORMANCE: Optimize images, minify and bundle CSS/JS, enable caching/compression, reduce bundle size, optimize template rendering and DB queries to minimize TTFB and CLS. Add client/server caching where it yields immediate gains.
8) SECURITY & STABILITY: Enforce CSRF and XSS protections, secure session handling, input validation, proper error handling, and logging. Ensure production settings (DEBUG=False), env-driven secrets, and no secrets in repo.
9) RESPONSIVENESS & QA: Test and fix mobile/tablet/desktop issues. Run cross-browser checks and accessibility audits (contrast, keyboard nav). Validate SEO basics (meta, titles, social tags). Fix alignment, overflow, spacing, and scaling issues.
10) CI / BUILD / RENDER PREP: Ensure requirements.txt, start/proc configuration, static file handling (Whitenoise or equivalent), migrations, and production settings are correct. Add render-deploy.md with exact Render env vars and deploy steps. Create/confirm automated build script and CI tasks if missing. Run migrations and smoke tests locally and produce an optimized production build.
11) FINAL POLISH & DELIVERY: Final visual polish (spacing, typography, animation easing), resolve QA blockers, run full test flows, and produce a clean production artifact. Commit changes with clear messages and open branch `release/render-ready`. Add audit.md and render-deploy.md in repo root.
Deliverable: a fully rebuilt, secure, high-performance, accessible, and visually polished Smart Invoice platform implemented directly in the workspace and ready to be deployed on Render with zero critical blockers. If any automated check or QA step fails, auto-fix and re-run until green. Document actions and results in audit.md and render-deploy.md.
