# AI Agent Prompt: Full Codebase Audit & Optimization for InvoiceFlow.com.ng

**Objective:**  
Perform a comprehensive, end-to-end audit and remediation of the InvoiceFlow.com.ng codebase. Ensure all frontend, backend, and deployment-related components are fully inspected, optimized, and production-ready. Address all issues, inefficiencies, and areas for improvement while maintaining compatibility with the Render deployment environment and the custom domain purchased from DomainKing.

## Scope of Work

### 1. Code Quality & Maintainability
- Analyze all frontend and backend code for readability, modularity, and adherence to best practices.  
- Identify and refactor duplicated, redundant, or unused code and files.  
- Remove placeholders, minimal implementations, and incomplete code segments.  
- Ensure proper documentation and consistent code formatting throughout the codebase.

### 2. Security
- Identify and remediate vulnerabilities, including injection points, insecure authentication, and data exposure risks.  
- Enforce secure coding practices across the application.  
- Audit dependency packages for known vulnerabilities and apply patches or updates.  
- Implement secure configuration for environment variables and secret management.

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Detect and resolve performance bottlenecks in backend logic, database queries, and API endpoints.  
- Optimize frontend load times, asset delivery, and rendering efficiency.  
- Ensure proper caching strategies, lazy loading, and resource optimization for faster page load.

### 4. Dependency & Environment Management
- Audit and update project dependencies, removing unused packages.  
- Ensure consistent environment configuration across development, staging, and production.  
- Verify all deployment scripts, CI/CD pipelines, and automation workflows are reliable, repeatable, and error-free.

### 5. Deployment & Domain Integration
- Validate compatibility with Render deployment environment.  
- Ensure custom domain (invoice.com.ng) integration via DomainKing is fully functional.  
- Confirm that server configurations, SSL/TLS certificates, and routing are correctly applied.  
- Optimize deployment scripts for reliability, rollback capabilities, and scalability.

### 6. Deliverables
- Fully cleaned, optimized, and secure codebase.  
- Report detailing all identified issues, applied fixes, and improvements.  
- Verification that the application is production-ready, deployed successfully on Render, and fully integrated with the custom domain.
