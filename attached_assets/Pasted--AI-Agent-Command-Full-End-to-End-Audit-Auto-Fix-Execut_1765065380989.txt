# AI Agent Command: Full End-to-End Audit + Auto-Fix Execution

Perform a complete, end-to-end audit of the entire platform in a single continuous execution flow. Inspect and analyze every component from backend to frontend, infrastructure, deployment, configurations, integrations, code quality, assets, documentation, and all other supporting layers without skipping any detail.

Identify all issues, errors, outdated patterns, security risks, UI/UX inconsistencies, performance bottlenecks, responsive design failures, broken links, inactive buttons, design flaws, non-operational routes, missing states, dead code, architectural weaknesses, configuration gaps, and any form of inefficiency across the platform.

The audit must include deep inspection of:

- Backend architecture, API endpoints, business logic, database schemas, services, authentication, and authorization patterns  
- Frontend structure, responsive layout frameworks, reusable design patterns, modern components, accessibility, UX flows, and UI behavior  
- Infrastructure stack, deployment configuration, runtime environments, CI/CD pipelines, DomainKing domain configuration, Render deployment architecture, caching layers, logging, monitoring, and security headers  
- All configuration files, environment variables, secrets management, dependency versions, compiler/packager settings, and build optimization  
- Documentation quality, architectural clarity, onboarding readiness, consistency, and completeness

After completing the audit, automatically implement all recommended fixes and enhancements. Apply modern and advanced development standards, including optimized backend structures, scalable service patterns, responsive UI/UX layouts, modern component patterns, accessibility compliance, and industry-leading security practices. Ensure all URLs, internal links, external links, and interactive UI elements function correctly and navigate to their intended destinations.

Resolve every identified issue with the best available strategic and technical solutions. Refactor code for clarity and performance, remove legacy patterns, optimize dependencies, improve build processes, reinforce security, enhance responsiveness, and deliver a clean, future-proof architecture.

Produce a final report detailing:
- Every issue discovered  
- The root cause of each issue  
- The exact changes made to fix it  
- Additional recommendations for ongoing optimization and modernization  
- A production readiness checklist including performance, scalability, security, and design improvements

The output must represent a fully audited, automatically corrected, modernized platform from the first file in the repository to the final deployed artifact.
