                <h2>18. Dispute Resolution</h2>
                <p>Any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service shall be resolved as follows:</p>
                <p><strong>Informal Resolution:</strong> Before initiating formal proceedings, you agree to contact us at legal@invoiceflow.com to attempt to resolve the dispute informally. We will work in good faith to address your concerns within 30 days.</p>
                <p><strong>Arbitration:</strong> If informal resolution is unsuccessful, any dispute shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the appropriate arbitration association. The arbitration shall be conducted in English, and the arbitrator's decision shall be binding and enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
                <p><strong>Class Action Waiver:</strong> You agree to resolve disputes with us on an individual basis and waive any right to participate in a class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration.</p>

                <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which InvoiceFlow is incorporated, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
                <p>You agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within that jurisdiction for the resolution of any disputes not subject to arbitration.</p>

                <p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable, or if modification is not possible, it shall be severed from these Terms. The invalidity of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions, which shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
