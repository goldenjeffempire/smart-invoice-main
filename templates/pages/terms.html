                    <p>Any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service shall be resolved as follows:</p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Informal Resolution:</strong> Before initiating formal proceedings, you agree to contact us at legal@invoiceflow.com to attempt to resolve the dispute informally. We will work in good faith to address your concerns within 30 days.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Arbitration:</strong> If informal resolution is unsuccessful, any dispute shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the appropriate arbitration association. The arbitration shall be conducted in English, and the arbitrator's decision shall be binding and enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Class Action Waiver:</strong> You agree to resolve disputes with us on an individual basis and waive any right to participate in a class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration.
